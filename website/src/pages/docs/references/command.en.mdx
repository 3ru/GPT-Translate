## Examples

### Single File

```bash
/gpt-translate ./README.md ./JA/README.md Japanese
```

The following directory structure changes are expected when this command is executed.

<BeforeAfter
  before={
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.File name='README.md' />
    </FileTree>
  }
  after={
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.File name='README.md' />
      <FileTree.Folder name='JA' defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name='README.md' active />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
  }
/>

`README.md` in the root is newly translated into `Japanese` as `README.md` under the `JA directory`.

### Multiple Files

<Callout type='info'>
  The input file specification method has been expanded since v1.1.6. Please
  refer to the [Path Specification page](./path-builder.mdx) for details.
</Callout>

```bash
/gpt-translate ./EN/*.md ./JA/*.md Japanese
```

The following directory structure changes are expected when this command is executed.

<BeforeAfter
  before={
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.File name='README.md' />
      <FileTree.Folder name='EN' defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name='getting-started.md' />
        <FileTree.File name='setup.md' />
        <FileTree.File name='hoge.webp' />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
  }
  after={
    <FileTree>
      <FileTree.File name='README.md' />
      <FileTree.Folder name='EN' defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name='getting-started.md' />
        <FileTree.File name='setup.md' />
        <FileTree.File name='hoge.webp' />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name='JA' defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name='getting-started.md' active />
        <FileTree.File name='setup.md' active />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree>
  }
/>

All markdown files under the `EN directory` will be translated and output under the new `JA directory`.

#### Tips

GitHub comments support markdown notation, so if you use an asterisk(\*), it will be converted to _italic type_.
This will still recognize the command normally, but it is recommended to enclose the command in `codespan` (\`).
