# Command Based

Translate by typing commands in the comments of Issues or PR.

## Workflow Settings Overview

```yaml filename="gpt-translate.yml"
name: GPT Translate

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  gpt_translate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run GPT Translate
        if: |
          contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gpt-translate') ||
          contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gt')
        uses: 3ru/gpt-translate@master
        with:
          apikey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

## Explanation

```yaml {2-3}
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
```

Each time an issue or pull request comment is created, actions is launched.

---

```yaml {2}
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

Check out the repository to the ubuntu environment.
This will give `gpt-translate` access to the files in the repository for translation.

In other words, you must always check out the repository in advance.

---

```yaml {2-4}
- name: Run GPT Translate
  if: |
    contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gpt-translate') ||
    contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gt')
  uses: 3ru/gpt-translate@master
  with:
    apikey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

Specifies the conditions under which `gpt-translate` is executed.

Here, if `/gpt-translate` or `/gt` is included in the comment, it moves to the next process.

---

```yaml {5}
- name: Run GPT Translate
  if: |
    contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gpt-translate') ||
    contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gt')
  uses: 3ru/gpt-translate@master
  with:
    apikey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

Run with `v1.1` `gpt-translate` action.

Instead of specifying a specific version, you can specify a major version `@1` or a branch `@master`.

---

```yaml
with:
  apikey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

Pass the OpenAI API Key from the repository secret (encrypted)
