# Commit Based

Every time there is a commit on a particular branch, translate it.

## Workflow Settings Overview

```yaml filename="gpt-translate-commit.yml"
name: GPT Translate per Commit

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  gpt_translate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository with two latest commits
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - name: get changed files name
        id: changed_files
        run: |
          echo "files=$(git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD | grep '\.md$' | tr '\n' ' ')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Run GPT Translate
        uses: 3ru/gpt-translate@v1.1.2
        with:
          apikey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          inputFiles: ${{ steps.changed_files.outputs.files }}
          outputFiles: 'JA/**/*.md FR/**/*.md'
          languages: 'Japanese French'
```

## Explanation

```yaml {2-4}
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

It is invoked whenever there is a commit on the `main` branch.

---

```yaml {3-5}
steps:
  - name: Checkout repository with two latest commits
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
    with:
      fetch-depth: 2
```

Check out the two most recent commits (HEAD and the one before it).

By comparing the latest commit with the one before it, we can get the diff files.

---

```yaml {2-4}
- name: get changed files name
  id: changed_files
  run: |
    echo "files=$(git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD | grep '\.md$' | tr '\n' ' ')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

- `id: changed_files`
  - Set id (`changed_files`) to refer to it from other steps.
- `git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD | grep '\.md$'`
  - Only markdown files are extracted from the diff files by the command in `run`.
- `tr '\n' ' '`
  - The files are then converted to a space-delimited format.
- `>> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`
  - Setting output parameters.

---

```yaml {5-7}
- name: Run GPT Translate
  uses: 3ru/gpt-translate@v1.1.2
  with:
    apikey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
    inputFiles: ${{ steps.changed_files.outputs.files }}
    outputFiles: 'JA/**/*.md FR/**/*.md'
    languages: 'Japanese French'
```

- `inputFiles`
  - Pass the file path value for the file to be translated that was output in the previous step.
- `outputFiles`
  - Specify two directories, `JA` and `FR`, as output destinations.
- `languages`
  - Specify translation into `Japanese` and `French`.
    It is important that the order matches the order of the `outputFiles`.
