# Error Handling

## Bot Errors

### `You have no permission to use`

This bot limits the execution of translations by commands, etc. to only **Write** permission users of the repository.
The OpenAI API is pay-as-you-go and I have put this restriction in place to protect users of my software from malicious users.

If you want to give command execution to any user, please invite them to the repository **collaborator**.

## API Errors

### `503` Error

Perhaps a limit on the number of calls to the OpenAI API has been reached. Please try again later.
[Help wanted](https://github.com/3ru/gpt-translate/issues/18) for essential solution.
