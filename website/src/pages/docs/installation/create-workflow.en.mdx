There are many ways to set up a workflow.

## By Command

The following is a sample configuration for performing translations in command format.

```yaml filename=".github/workflows/gpt-translate.yml"
name: GPT Translate

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  gpt_translate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run GPT Translate
        if: |
          contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gpt-translate') || 
          contains(github.event.comment.body, '/gt')
        uses: 3ru/gpt-translate@master
        with:
          apikey: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

#### Required

- Provide the `OPENAI_API_KEY` as apiKey.
  - Necessary for OpenAI model use
- Checkout in advance(`actions/checkout@v3`).
  - It must be checkedout before running GPT Translate to retrieve the file contents of the translation.

Once the above workflow is set up and pushed, the translation can be performed by entering commands in the **comments of issues** and **PRs**.
