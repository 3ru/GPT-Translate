# The Motivation



As a non-native English-speaking developer, I've encountered various difficulties when working with open-source software. The energy and time spent translating English documentation, the limitation in information accessibility due to language barriers, the challenges of communicating in a community where English is a prerequisite, and the restrictions in the scope of official support have all contributed to a significant decrease in development efficiency and progress. These problems are common among all developers. Even for English speakers, it can be challenging to use software written in a non-native language, such as Japanese in my case. This situation signifies that there's a room for improvement in how software caters to its developers and users regarding convenience and accessibility.

However, the cost of translating documentation into each user's language can be prohibitively high. The more extensive the documentation, the more significant the burden on the translators becomes. It can also be challenging to maintain motivation for continuous work in such a situation.

In response to these challenges, I developed GPT-Translate, an automated translation workflow. This tool makes it possible to easily translate documentation written in any language and deliver it to end-users. By doing so, it significantly alleviates the issues I've mentioned, removing barriers to development. By leveraging machine translation of high accuracy for the most substantial hurdle - the initial translation process, developers can invest more time in coding and problem-solving, ultimately improving the overall efficiency of the project.

I envision `GPT-Translate` to bridge the language gap, facilitating an inclusive, global community of developers and users, and setting the stage for a more efficient, collaborative open-source ecosystem.
